Simple Django blog.
Main idea was to create base platform for my photos storage and posting some articles about local bicycle events.
Project consists of two apps - BlogPost and ImagePool. Backend based on django with some additional modules, frontend depends on css, js (jquery), some styles was taken from bootstrap.
